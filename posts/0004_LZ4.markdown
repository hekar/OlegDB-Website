title:Measuring the Effects of LZ4 Compression

Way back in `0.1.1` we added the ability to compress your data using LZ4. Since
I haven't written in a while and we'd never really measured the performance
aspects of using LZ4, I figured now was as good a time as any. Segfaults are
low, moral is high and [coverity](https://scan.coverity.com/) isn't yelling at us.

We use LZ4 compression for a couple of reasons, mainly that it's fast and that
it reduces the memory required to store items both on-disk and in-memory. Ever
since I rewrote the databse to use `mmap()` the second one hasn't really been an
issue, but on-disk compression is still something nice to have. Given how easy
LZ4 was to add to the project and how [fast it is](https://code.google.com/p/lz4/)
this is basically a win-win.

So, to get started I wrote a naive memory checking script in bash that you can
look at [here.](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/blob/master/integrity_test/mem_usage.sh)
The gist is that it uses Linux's [smap](http://www.mjmwired.net/kernel/Documentation/filesystems/proc.txt)
subsystem that resides in `/proc` to grab memory usage of a process. I say naive
because the only thing I grabbed during the test was the total size used by the
Erlang process. For my purposes this was more than enough.

So, with this script running as fast as it could logging memory usage and a
millisecond Unix timestamp, I ran `fill_fast()` in [torture.py](https://github.com/infoforcefeed/OlegDB/blob/master/integrity_test/torture.py#L6)
from our medley of weird testing scripts on 8 threads and let it go.

I ran two tests: One with `OL_F_LZ4` enabled and one without. To speed up the
filling of the databases a little bit I also disabled `OL_F_AOL_FFLUSH`. This
only makes sure the AOL file is `fsync()`'d to disk.

First, let's look at memory usage over time without LZ4 compression:

<div id="normal_output" style="min-width: 300px; height: 300px; margin: 1em"></div>
<div id="lz4_output" style="min-width: 300px; height: 300px; margin: 1em"></div>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/standalone-framework.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/highcharts.js"></script>
<script type="text/javascript" src="/static/js/0004_charts.js"</script>
