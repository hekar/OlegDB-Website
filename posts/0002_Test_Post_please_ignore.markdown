Every now and then you get a real bad cut on your hot bod somewhere and it's
just totally the worst thing ever. You're like, 'Damn, how did this happen to
me?' and then 'Well, now that the worst has happened, what can I do about it?'

Well I don't really have those crazy answers for you, but you'd be damn lucky
not to pass out from the totally crazy and unnecessary world you live it. Whats
that like, I wonder?
